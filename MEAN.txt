Node Version Manager - Simple bash script to manage multiple active node.js versions

# Installing node.js
You should install node.js with nvm, because that way you do not have to provide superuser privileges when installing global packages (you can simply execute "npm install -g packagename" without prepending 'sudo').

Brew is fantastic for other things, however. I tend to be biased towards Bower whenever I have the option to install something with Bower.

# I installed node and npm from https://nodejs.org/en/#download.  Installed them into /usr/local

Express.js is a Node.js web application server framework, designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications.[1] It is the de facto standard server framework for node.js.[2] The original author, TJ Holowaychuck, described it as a Sinatra-inspired server,[3] meaning that it is relatively minimal with many features available as plugins.

Express is the backend part of the MEAN stack, together with MongoDB database and AngularJS frontend framework.

npm install express -g
npm install -g express-generator

# brew install mongodb
To have launchd start mongodb at login:
  ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mongodb/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load mongodb now:
  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
  mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf

  # Start mongodb:
  mongod
     ltrwaiting for connections on port 27017


# Install bower:
npm install -g bower

# update npm:
npm update -g npm
