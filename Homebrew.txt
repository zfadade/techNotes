The easiest way to install various Unix tools and open source software onto Mac OS X is via a package manager:

brew update && brew upgrade


brew update			# updates Homebrew
brew doctor
brew search			# search for application
brew install <app>		# e.g, git
brew list
brew remove <app>
brew outdated - list outdated packages
brew update && brew upgrade - update brew and packages

Installs into /usr/local

Error:  Could not symlink share/git-core/contrib /usr/local/share/git-core is not writable

Solution:
Maybe you use sudo to install some application before ,So the owner of dictionary /usr/local/share/ and /usr/local/lib become root


sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/share/

sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/lib
