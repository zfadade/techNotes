MERGE_HEAD is present when a merge is in progress.

# Check out remote branch
git fetch
git checkout test

# But if there are multiple remotes, must do:
git checkout -b test remote-name/test

# See what has been added, but not committed:
git diff --staged

# See what will be pushed:
git push --dry-run

# Double Dot: commits reachable from 2nd commit, but not in first
# What is in HEAD but not in remote branch (i.e., what will be pushed)
git log feature/CSPB-530201-remove-shelldedup-table..HEAD

# All commits reachable from refA or refB, but not refC, i.e., what is NOT in my branch
git log refA refB ^refC
git log refA refB --not refC

# Triple Dot: commits in either of two references, but not in both
git log --left-right master...experiment
# Output: shows that master has E<--F, whereas experiment has D<--E
< F
< E
> D
> C
